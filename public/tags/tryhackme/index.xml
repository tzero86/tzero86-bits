      <description>Daily Bugle - THM Room This is a writeup or another one of my noob friendly(I hope) post-thingy for Daily Bugle TryhackMe&amp;rsquo;s room. This is a pretty raw writeup detailing all my process to root this room, flaws and all. Yup, I also write down my failed attempts to better illustrate my derailed train of thought.
You have been warned :)
Enjoy!

      <description>THM - EasyCTF/SimpleCTF Writeup Welcome to my second write-up for a TryHackme machine, in this case we&amp;rsquo;ll be solving EasyCTF or should I say SimpleCTF It seems to be called as both by looking at the room name and URL. Anyways, I invite you to try out this room on TryHackme by following the link below.

      <description>Alfred - TryHackme&amp;rsquo;s Room Writeup This is my first attempt at creating a write-up, I tried putting every single step I took to solve this room. While providing enough (I think) details and descriptions so it is useful for noobs like me mostly. I started drafting this at the same time I managed to solve a question or even right after thinking a way to approach a solution for any of those.</description>
