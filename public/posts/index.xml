      <description>Alfred - TryHackme&amp;rsquo;s Room Writeup This is my first attempt at creating a write-up, I tried putting every single step I took to solve this room. While providing enough (I think) details and descriptions so it is useful for noobs like me mostly. I started drafting this at the same time I managed to solve a question or even right after thinking a way to approach a solution for any of those.</description>

 For example, the binary file to change your password has the SUID bit set on it (/usr/bin/passwd).</description>
