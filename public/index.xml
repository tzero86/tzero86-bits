      <description>Daily Bugle - THM Room This is a writeup or another one of my noob friendly(I hope) post-thingy for Daily Bugle TryhackMe&amp;rsquo;s room. This is a pretty raw writeup detailing all my process to root this room, flaws and all. Yup, I also write down my failed attempts to better illustrate my derailed train of thought.
You have been warned :)
Enjoy!

      <description>THM - EasyCTF/SimpleCTF Writeup Welcome to my second write-up for a TryHackme machine, in this case we&amp;rsquo;ll be solving EasyCTF or should I say SimpleCTF It seems to be called as both by looking at the room name and URL. Anyways, I invite you to try out this room on TryHackme by following the link below.

      <description>Alfred - TryHackme&amp;rsquo;s Room Writeup This is my first attempt at creating a write-up, I tried putting every single step I took to solve this room. While providing enough (I think) details and descriptions so it is useful for noobs like me mostly. I started drafting this at the same time I managed to solve a question or even right after thinking a way to approach a solution for any of those.</description>

      <description># Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch&amp;rsquo;intrate
I&amp;rsquo;m a software quality engineer by day, a perpetual student by night. Trying hard to learn ethical hacking and penetration testing. This is my space, a refuge for the noob. I also play bass when somehow I find myself away from a computer.
This is just the start and I really mean the start, I been learning this for just about 3 months. Can&amp;rsquo;t image the amount of things I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to learn.</description>

      <description>#How to locate SUID Files using Find command#  In Linux, SUID (set owner userId upon execution) is a special type of &amp;gt;file permission given to a file. SUID gives temporary permissions to a &amp;gt;user to run the program/file with the permission of the file owner (rather &amp;gt;than the user who runs it). {TryHackme}
 For example, the binary file to change your password has the SUID bit set on it (/usr/bin/passwd).</description>
