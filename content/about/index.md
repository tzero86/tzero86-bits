_# Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate_


Hello, my name is Elias. I'm a software quality engineer by day, a perpetual student by night. Trying hard to learn ethical hacking and penetration testing. This is my space, where I upload guides, walkthroughs, notes, and pretty much anything related to Ethical Hacking. I might even upload articles related to Software Testing and Automated Testing (or even music!), which I also enjoy a lot. I love to play bass guitar When somehow I find myself away from a computer.

Welcome to this digital refuge, here we abide by the 'never stop learning' principle. I hope you find some of the content useful for your own learning journey.

Feel free to reach out to me via twitter [@tzero86](https://twitter.com/Tzero86) anytime. Happy hacking, happy learning.
