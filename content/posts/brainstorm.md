# Brainstorm - THM Room

This is another writeup, this time for TryhackMe's 'Brainstorm' room that is part of the Offensive Pentesting path. This is a writeup detailing all my process to root this room, flaws and all. I embrace mistakes and try to learn from them, therefore this post also includes my failed attempts. You have been warned :)

Leave a comment, leave your feedback or suggestions. It's all welcome, Have a great day!

Enjoy!

- **PLEASE NOTE:** Passwords, flag values, or any kind of answers to the room questions were intentionally masked as required by THM writeups rules. The write-up follows my step by step solution to this box, errors, and all. They are usually long :laughing:
