This is just the start. The first step towards a great adventure of hacking, pentesting and hopefully bug bounty related things. However, this is not intended to be a guide of any kind. This a noob palace of sorts. There is no learning without challenge, there is no challenge without pain. Those who struggle, learn the way.

Happy hacking.
